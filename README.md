Almost there. Almost.

I think I have it now. This repo is about to get a clean restart.

I've been working since yesterday on establishing a proper workflow for myself. I'm almost there.

This project has turned into an AppVeyor experiment. I'm going to delete this repository soon and replace it with a clean commit, once I figure out the proper AV setup.

The file searcher ( point 3 below ) will be finished soon. I haven't been feeling right these days but I'm using the time to read up on "modern C++" when I'm not sleeping. I'm still enamored with the language but it requires total commitment. In my weaker moments I'm beginning to seriously consider writing little tools like this in assembly. I've begun writing a high-level assembler ( or rather a FASM preprocessor ) in the past and may be upping it to GH soon. Right now I'm going to be looking at those GH pages to turn these blurbs into a blog.

Working on:
	# command line options ( what should the program do? ),
	# argument parser ( boost::program_options?, getopt?, regex? ),
	# finding luaXX.dll and love.exe in PATH,
	# custom ( non-compressing ) zip packer ( no dependencies! ).
